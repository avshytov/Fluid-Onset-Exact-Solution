# Fluid-Onset-Exact-Solution

The code in this project implements a computational model of e-fluid confined to a half-plane.
The quantum Boltzmann equation, with a simplistic choice of the momentum-conserving collision
integral, admits an exact solution via the Wiener-Hopf method, as outlined in the notes. 
The solution is applicable at all relevant scales: shorter than the mean-free path, much larger
than the mean-free path, and of the order of the mean-free path. Thereby, one can employ 
the model implemented here to study the crossover between ballistic transport and fluidity, 
as well as the ohmic regime.
